# FireblocksSDK

Fireblocks NCW iOS SDK 

Version 2.4.0

Version 2.4.0 is now supporting both EdDSA and ECDSA algorithms.

By default, workspaces are not enabled with EdDSA so you may remove MPC_EDDSA_ED25519 when calling generateMPCKeys
Please ask your CSM or in the https://community.fireblocks.com/ to enable your workspace to support EdDSA if you wish to work with EdDSA chains.
