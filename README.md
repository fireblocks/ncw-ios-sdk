Fireblocks NCW iOS SDK 

What's new in 2.6.0

In version 2.6.0, weâ€™ve introduced a few major enhancements.

1. Direct reporting of errors to Fireblocks. This will ease the process of supporting and debugging issues in the future. More information can be found here https://ncw-developers.fireblocks.com/docs/ncw-sdk-telemetry-collection

2. Our MPC ceremony processes have been enhanced for greater robustness. MPC messages will now undergo multiple retry attempts before failing.

3. Unexpected device errors will now result in the expected messaging, and not in a timeout.
