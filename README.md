Fireblocks NCW iOS SDK 

What's new in 2.7.1

In version 2.7.1, weâ€™ve introduced a few major enhancements.

1. Resolved an issue when trying to sign a transaction that has failed or will fail before it can even be signed.

2. Improved error reporting to Fireblocks

3. Improved error visibility: wrong passphrase in the recovery process is now explicitly mentioned in the returned error as WRONG_RECOVERY_PASSPHRASE (603)
